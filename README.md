Project Title:   Crop Recommendation System

Description:
	The Crop Recommendation system is designed to assist farmer in making informed decision about which crops to plant based on various environmental factor.  By leveraging the Random Forest Classifier Algorithm,  The system aims to optimize crop yield and profitability.

Tech Stack:
	Used Language:  Python 
	Algorithm: Random Forest Classification
	Tools:  Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Streamlit.

Methodology:
1)	Data Collection & Preprocessing:
o	Gather historical and real time data on soil properties, weather patterns and crop yields from various sources.
o	Preprocess the data to handle missing values, normalize features and covert categorical variables.
2)	Feature Selection:
o	Identify key features that influence crop growth and yield, such as soil pH, Nitrogen, Temperature, Rainfall and Humidity.
3)	Model Development:
o	Implement the Random Forest Classification Algorithm to build the prediction model and Train the model using the preprocessed datasets.

4)	Model Evaluation:
o	Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.
5)	User Interface:
o	Develop a user-friendly website where farmers can enter environmental data and to get receive crop recommendation. 

Output:

 
Conclusion:
	The Crop Recommendation System using Random Forest Classification offers a promising solution to enhance agricultural productivity and support sustainable farming practices. This projects aims to empower framers with the knowledge and tools needed to optimize their crop choice and achieve better outcomes.
